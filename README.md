# Auctus Platform Demo

The idea behind the Auctus platform is to provide a global smart contract based platform for pension fund management. The platform will allow to easily configure pension fund rules and to automatically generate smart contract code, as well as to deploy it on the Ethereum network. The demo version of the platform includes simulation features because it would be very difficult to understand the usability with an alpha release, without a simulation feature that mimics changing funds over time.
